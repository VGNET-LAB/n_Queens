## 🌐 Web Version (Solver & Visualizer)  

- Choose **N (4–20 queens)** and watch the solver find solutions automatically.  
- Displays **all possible solutions** with visual chessboard placement.  
- Generates a **search tree** to show how the algorithm explores solutions.  
- Supports **multiple search techniques** (BFS, DFS, etc.).  
- Built with a simple and interactive **web UI** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
